# React Kata

This project is a tool to help screen front-end React candidates in a variety of
areas by providing a simple project to build upon given a set of mock
requirements.


### Setup

Ensure you have the following packages installed and updated to the latest
versions:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Execute the following commands in your terminal to get started:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LesterLogic/react-kata.git
cd react-kata
npm install
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will reload as you make file changes.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


In a separate terminal start the mock REST API server:

```sh
npm run server
```

Runs the mock REST API service through a local proxy at
[http://localhost:2000](http://localhost:2000).


**Remember:**: This is an exercise to showcase a range of professional qualities
and, due to limited time, do not need to follow as robust a process as a real
production application.
